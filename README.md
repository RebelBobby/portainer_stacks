# linked in post I made about portainer_stacks

Folks have asked me about the cloud I use, there are many free open source ones but i use "NextCloud"; you can text, call, vid call, calendar, share files, auto download to your hardware from android or iPhone app upon entering any trusted Wi-Fi you want. A cloud isn't mist in the air, its data which sits on hardware. The difference here, is that the data and messages etc sits on YOUR hardware with no middleman between you and your hardware. This set up it's more interactive that what you're paying for. Here is the catch; it takes a little bit of understanding but you can do it if you try.

You can find guidance on YouTube and self-researching but when your at the point of launching docker you can use my code which will launch the programs.

It's free open source called nextcloud. The docker io advertised database wonâ€™t work on a raspberry pi so I use a different one which is listed on my github in the comments.

You can find a few other programs I use such as a home lab dashboard called "heimdall", a website called you can launch called "bookstack" and a network architecting rig called "Wireshark".

This is my NextCloud dashboard, its free open source which is completely customizable as you can also do.
